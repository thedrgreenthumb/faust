Here are some experimental Faust (http://faust.grame.fr/) effects:

duck_reverb.dsp - ducking reverberator, freeverb faust implementation borrow from Guitarix(http://guitarix.sourceforge.net/).

freeverb3.dsp - !Reverberator not stable! 
	Faust implementation of freeverb3 (http://freeverb3vst.sourceforge.jp/doc/Progenitor.jpg).

parametric_pitch_shifter.dsp - here is pitch-shifter, where shifting, 
	controled by combination of signals, from amplitude follower and sine generator,
	what are provide really sophisticated psicho sounds.

rotary_speakers.dsp - As is.

shimmer.dsp - !Reverberator not stable! 
	The allpass tank reverberator, combined with parametric pitch-shifter.
